# Sentiment Analysis of Netflix's Squid Game Tweets ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸ“Œ Goal
To analyze public sentiment towards Netflix's *Squid Game* using deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, SimpleRNN, Bi-LSTM) on over 80,000 tweets.  
The aim is to help understand audience opinions and extract insights that could guide content strategy.

## ðŸš€ Usage
1. Download dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project folder.  
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis_Netflix_Squid_Game.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells to:
   - Preprocess data  
   - Train models (LSTM, GRU, SimpleRNN, Bi-LSTM)  
   - Compare accuracy and performance
